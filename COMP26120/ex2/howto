	How to write, compile, debug and run C programs on Linux
	========================================================

There are some prompts below, but you should add anything else you think

man commandName


Writing C programs
==================
nano programName.c

Compiling C programs
====================
make programName //compiling
make -g programName //produce debugging information in the operating system's native format. GDB can work with this debugging information. 
make -std=c99 programName //c99 is one of the standards of compiling. This option is used to set up the standard of compiling.
make -o fileA programName //Place output in file fileA.
make -Wall programName // Enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid(or modify to prevent the warnin), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some language-specific warnings described in C++ Dialect Options and Objective-C++ Dialect Options.

Linking C programs
==================
Using make

Running C programs

Comparing output from C and Java programs
