Nintendo has revealed that its next games machine will be a handheld, portable device that doubles up as a home console.
Previously code-named NX, now named the Nintendo Switch, the device looks like a tablet computer with controllers that attach to its sides.
The device was revealed in a short "teaser" video posted on YouTube.
One analyst said the device could be Nintendo's "last shot" at selling a home console.
